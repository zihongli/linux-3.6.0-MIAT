config ZYNQ_EARLY_UART1
	bool "Early Printk On UART1 (2nd UART)"
	default n
	help
	  Select if you want to use the 2nd UART (UART1) in Zynq for the early
	  printk. If not selected, the 1st UART (UART0) is used.

config ZYNQ_EARLY_UART_EP107
	bool "Early UART Clock Input For EP107"
	default y
	help
	  Select if you want the kernel to be setup for the EP107 board which is
	  using a 50 MHz clock into the UART. Not selecting this causes a clock into
	  the UART that is based on a 33.333 MHz clock divided down by 63.  Note that
	  this only affects early printk.

config XILINX_FIXED_DEVTREE_ADDR
	bool "Device Tree At Fixed Address"
	default n
	depends on OF
	help
	  Select if you want the kernel to assume a device tree is located at a
	  fixed address of 0x1000000 on kernel boot.  This allows the go command
	  in u-boot to be used since the bootm command is slow in the EP107.

config XILINX_L1_PREFETCH
	bool "L1 Cache Prefetch"
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on L1 cache prefetching to get the best performance
	  in many cases. This may not always be the best performance depending on
	  the usage. There are some cases where this may cause issues when booting.

config XILINX_L2_PREFETCH
	bool "L2 Cache Prefetch"
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on L2 cache prefetching to get the best performance
	  in many cases. This may not always be the best performance depending on
	  the usage.

config XILINX_ZED
	bool "Using USB OTG on the Digilent ZED board"
	default n
	depends on USB_SUPPORT
	select USB_ULPI if USB_SUPPORT
	select USB_ULPI_VIEWPORT if USB_SUPPORT
	help
	  Select this option if using the USB OTG port on the Digilent ZED board
	  as a USB on-the-go port. This option is necessary to properly
	  initialize the TUSB1210 USB PHY used on the ZED board as an
	  on-the-go USB port that can supply power to a USB slave device. 

config XILINX_TEST
	bool "Testing On Kernel Boot"
	default n
	help
	  Select if you want kernel tests to run on boot.  The tests may take
	  several minutes on kernel boot.

config XILINX_AXIPCIE
	bool "Xilinx AXI PCIe host bridge support"
	select PCI
	select ARCH_SUPPORTS_MSI
	help
	  Say 'Y' here if you want kernel to support the Xilinx AXI PCIe
	  Host Bridge. This supports Message Signal Interrupts (MSI), if you
	  want to use this feature select CONFIG_PCI_MSI from 'Bus Support ->'.
