	select IIO_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD9467 and AD9643,
	  High-Speed LVDS analog to digital converters (ADC).
	  FPGA interface HDL is available here:
	  http://wiki.analog.com/resources/fpga/xilinx/fmc/ad9467
	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cf_axi_adc.
